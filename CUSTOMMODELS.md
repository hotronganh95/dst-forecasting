            inputs (pd.DataFrame): Preprocessed input data for the model, containing:
                - `timestamp` (datetime): Datetime information (column can also be named `ds`).

**Input Format**

The input to `run_inference` is a pandas DataFrame with:

- `timestamp`: Datetime values representing observation times.
- `value`: Float values representing the Dst index.

**Output Format**  
The output must be a dictionary with the following keys:

- `predicted_value`: A single float representing the predicted Dst index.
- `prediction_time`: A string in UTC using the ISO 8601 format.

**Example Output**:

    "predicted_value": -24.5,
    "prediction_time": "2024-12-10T02:00:00+00:00"
}
```

### Handling Dependencies

If your custom model requires external libraries (e.g., `pytorch`, `scikit-learn`), ensure they are included in your environment.

You can update your `requirements.txt` file with any additional dependencies.
